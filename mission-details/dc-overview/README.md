## Short description
Extend a Kyma based multitenant application with day 2 operations

## Description
You have created a multitenant application running on SAP Business Technology Platform, Kyma runtime and you want to make sure that you are ready to manage the day 2 operations of your application once it’s live? This mission is then probably helpful for you as we are explaining here how to manage your application logs, how to monitor your application with standard and custom metrics, how to optimize future deployments via Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD). To explain these different topics, we are using the multitenant application Easy Franchise as basis application. You may consider the related mission „Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime“ as prerequisite for this mission.

## Pain Points
Running a multitenant application in the cloud brings several challenges like managing the application logs and metrics so you can verify that everything is as expected. Probably you want also to reuse your existing observability framework and understand how such an integration can be done. Moreover, once the application is used by customers, you need to know how you can meter the application consumption. Finally, being agile you want to deploy on regular basis with less efforts. 

## Benefits
Going through the mission, you will learn how to handle logs in the SAP Business Technology Platform, Kyma runtime, how to monitor standard and custom metrics and of course how to consume them from the tool of your choice. At the end, you will see how to easily deploy some applications components after having done some changes.

## Journey
You will start with the deployment of the Easy Franchise application using the btp-setup-automator and then you will extend it to get an overview of the customers consumption. As second step, you will setup the right development environment to manage logs and metrics to consume them first from the provided tools and then from an external environment to simulate how you can do it with any other observability framework. As a last step, you will update and deploy some components via SAP CI/CD.”
